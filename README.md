# Conn Server

*"Mr. Spock, you have the Conn!"* 🖖

A self-hosted server that lets you interact with [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) from any device over your network. Run Claude on a home server, connect from your phone or any WebSocket client.

## Features

- **WebSocket streaming** — real-time text deltas, tool use events, and image sharing
- **Multiple concurrent conversations** — each with its own Claude process and working directory
- **Session resume** — conversations persist across reconnects
- **Project context** — point each conversation at a different project directory
- **MCP integration** — configure Model Context Protocol servers for extended tool access
- **Web preview** — auto-detect and serve dev servers for web projects
- **Built-in TLS** — auto-generated EC P-256 self-signed certificate with cert pinning (no CA needed)
- **Self-hosted updates** — optionally serve app releases from the server

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (the Claude CLI) — `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`

## Quick Start

### Install from PyPI

```bash
pipx install conn-server
conn-server start
```

On first run, `conn-server start` will:
1. Check that the Claude CLI is installed (guides you through installation if not)
2. Walk you through configuration (port, projects directory)
3. Generate TLS certificates and an auth token
4. Ask if you want to install as a background service (launchd on macOS, systemd on Linux)
5. Display a QR code for the mobile app

**Prerequisites** (if you don't have them):
- Python 3.10+ — `brew install python` or download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- pipx — `brew install pipx` (or `python3 -m pip install --user pipx && python3 -m pipx ensurepath`)
- Node.js — `brew install node` or download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (needed for Claude CLI)
- Claude CLI — `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code && claude` (to authenticate)

### CLI Commands

```bash
conn-server start     # Start the server (interactive setup on first run)
conn-server stop      # Stop the background service
conn-server restart   # Restart the background service
conn-server status    # Show server status and health
conn-server setup     # Reconfigure (port, projects directory, auth token)
conn-server upgrade   # Upgrade to latest version and restart
conn-server qr        # Show the connection QR code
conn-server config    # Show current configuration
conn-server logs      # Show recent server logs
conn-server logs -f   # Follow logs in real time
conn-server version   # Show version
```

### Developer Setup (from source)

If you're contributing or want to run from the repo:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This creates a virtual environment, installs dependencies via `pip install -e .`, walks through configuration, and optionally installs the system service. The `setup.sh` script also handles Homebrew Python detection on macOS for OpenSSL compatibility.

## Configuration

The server reads from `~/.conn/config.json`:

```json
{
  "auth_token": "your-secret-token",
  "host": "0.0.0.0",
  "port": 8443,
  "working_dir": "~/Projects"
}
```

Environment variables override the config file:
- `CONN_HOST` — bind address
- `CONN_PORT` — listen port
- `CONN_WORKING_DIR` — root directory for project listing

## API

All endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer {token}` unless noted.

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/health` | Health check (no auth) |
| `GET` | `/conversations` | List all conversations |
| `GET` | `/conversations/active` | List running conversation IDs |
| `DELETE` | `/conversations/{id}` | Delete conversation |
| `GET` | `/conversations/{id}/history` | Get message history |
| `POST` | `/upload?conversation_id={id}` | Upload image |
| `GET` | `/projects` | List available project directories |
| `POST` | `/restart` | Gracefully restart server |

See [docs/api.md](docs/api.md) for the full REST and WebSocket protocol reference.

## Building a Custom Client

The WebSocket protocol is straightforward. Connect to `wss://{host}:{port}/ws/chat` (or `ws://` if TLS is not configured) and:

1. **Authenticate** — send `{"type": "auth", "token": "..."}` as the first message. Server responds with `{"type": "auth_ok"}`.
2. **Create a conversation** — send `{"type": "new_conversation", "conversation_id": "uuid", "name": "My Chat", "working_dir": "/path/to/project"}`
3. **Send messages** — send `{"type": "message", "text": "hello", "conversation_id": "uuid"}`
4. **Receive streaming responses** — the server sends `text_delta`, `tool_start`, `tool_done`, and `message_complete` events with the `conversation_id`
5. **Cancel** — send `{"type": "cancel", "conversation_id": "uuid"}` to stop a running response

The server sends `{"type": "ping"}` every 15 seconds; respond with `{"type": "pong"}` to keep the connection alive.

See [docs/api.md](docs/api.md) for all message types and payloads.

## Data Directory

All server data lives in `~/.conn/`:

```
~/.conn/
├── config.json           # Server configuration
├── sessions.json         # Active conversation metadata
├── tls/                  # TLS certificates (auto-generated on first run)
│   ├── server.crt        # EC P-256 certificate (PEM)
│   └── server.key        # Private key (PEM, 0600 permissions)

├── worktrees/            # Git worktrees for conversations
└── mcp_servers.json      # MCP server configuration
```

## TLS

The server generates a self-signed EC P-256 certificate on first run and serves all traffic over HTTPS (port 8443). The certificate's DER bytes are included in the startup QR code so the mobile app can pin the exact certificate — no CA or reverse proxy needed.

To regenerate certificates:
```bash
rm -rf ~/.conn/tls/
# Restart the server — new certs are generated automatically
# Re-scan the QR code on all connected devices
```

**macOS note**: System Python links against LibreSSL, which has TLS handshake issues with Android's BoringSSL. Use Homebrew Python (`brew install python`) instead. The setup script handles this automatically.

## Project Structure

The server is packaged as `conn-server` on PyPI. Source code lives in the `conn_server/` package:
